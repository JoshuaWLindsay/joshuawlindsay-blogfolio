The first 30 days of a foster-care placement can feel chaotic and stressful. Even after having nine foster children in five separate placements over the past four years, I am still always taken off guard at how many things have to get done in those first 30 days. In this post I want to bullet-point for you the main things that need to be completed within the first 30 days of a foster placement. For fellow foster parents, I hope this is a helpful guide. For those who support foster families, I hope this provides you a window into what gets added to a foster parent’s plate when they accept a placement, and encourages you to come alongside them in providing extra support.

Not all of these bullet points have to be completed for every child who enters your home. Some of these items only apply to children of certain ages. And some may have been completed already by a previous placement if they are coming from another foster home, group home, or shelter. You can speak with your caseworker about which items may have already been completed.

## The first 24 hours:

- You should receive a big stack of paperwork when the caseworker brings the children to your home. Occasionally, though, something will be missing and you will need to request it from the caseworker. Many of these documents will be necessary to complete everything else on this list during the first 30 days.
  - Signed copies of the Placement Authorization, Education Decision Maker, and Medical Consenter
  - Copy of the Birth Certificate (or CPS printout alternative)
  - Copy of the Social Security Card (or number)
  - Medicaid Card (or number if a card hasn’t been requested yet)
  - Vaccination Record

## The first three days:

- Initial health appointment: If this is a child’s first time in foster care, then they will need to be seen by a health professional within the first 72 hours of placement. This is not required for kids coming from other placements (unless the caseworker states otherwise). If a child comes without a Medicaid card, you will need to find a pediatrician who will take them with only a number; call around and ask before you make an appointment.
- School enrollment: If a child is Kindergarten age or older, then they need to be enrolled in your local public school within the first three days of placement. (Please note, if you do not have a vaccination record yet, the school is still legally required to enroll the child). If your child has an IEP or 504 plan, make sure the school knows this and is prepared to implement those plans. Foster children also qualify for free meals at school; you can sign them up for meals after completing the school enrollment.

## The first two weeks:

- Adversary hearing: If this is a child’s first placement, then they will have a court hearing within the first two weeks that will establish a legal plan and set a schedule for future court dates.
- Initial family visit: If you are the child’s first placement, then the CPS investigator or caseworker will be contacting you about scheduling the first family visit that should take place no later than five days following the adversary hearing.
- Visitation plan: The caseworker will work with you to set up a regular schedule for visits with the child’s parents and/or other family members.

## The first 30 days:

- Pediatrician appointment: Make an appointment with a pediatrician to establish care and take care of any tests, vaccinations, or referrals to specialists. If a child is new to foster care, they will need a vision screening, a hearing screening, and a PPD test. Newborns will need to be seen at 2 weeks for this appointment.
- Dentist Appointment: If you are a child’s first placement, then they will need a dental exam and cleaning within the first 30 days.
- CANS assessment: Every child over the age of three must have a CANS assessment completed within the first 30 days of entering foster care. This is a behavioral health assessment and must be done by a behavioral health doctor. Some agencies will provide CANS through the agency. If yours does not, you can call the number on the back of the Medicaid card to get a list of behavioral health doctors in your area.
- Psych Eval: Depending on the age, developmental needs, and behaviors of a child, the caseworker may require you to schedule a psychiatric evaluation for the child. Your agency should be able to give you a list of places you can get this done in your area.
- Psychiatric appointment: Is the child on any psychiatric medications? If so, then you need to make an appointment with a psychiatrist or another doctor who is willing to manage medications for the child. (If the child is on medication for ADHD, a pediatrician may be willing to manage meds, but most pediatricians will not be willing to manage other psychiatric meds such as mood stabilizers).
